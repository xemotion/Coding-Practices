dhtmlxGantt is an open source JavaScript Gantt chart that helps you illustrate a project schedule in a nice-looking chart. It can show the dependencies between tasks as lines and allows you to set up different relationships between tasks (finish-to-start, start-to-start, end-to-end). dhtmlxGantt provides a flexible API and a large number of event handlers, which gives you the freedom to customize it for your needs.
